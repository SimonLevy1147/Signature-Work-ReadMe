  The first two projects I have chosen to highlight, the 15 Squares Puzzle and Sudoku, are personal projects I completed over the last 2 years. After completing a class on Java and JavaFX here at St. Thomas, I wanted to see how I could apply those skills in other projects on my own. I was already familiar with the games, so that helped in my implementation. The project that gave me the idea to create those games in the first place was Battleboats. I completed that project for an earlier class while I was still at the U of M. It is more rudimentary in its graphical design, comprising of only a text-based GUI, but the logic is more complex since I worked with a partner over the course of several weeks. I thoroughly enjoyed implementing Battleship and this is a large part of why I implemented other games in Java. Solar Simulator and Gradebook were also projects from earlier classes. I chose to highlight them since they are in other languages and encompass python's graphics engine in Solar Simulator and clean memory management in C in the Gradebook.
